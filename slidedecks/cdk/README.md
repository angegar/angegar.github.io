# Problem Statement

<!--
Lien avec les SRE qui doivent gérer de l'infrastructure avec du code
-->
SRE needs to :

- Manage infrastructures at scale (CDK)
- Manage applications configuration at scale ([CDKTF](https://www.terraform.io/cdktf) | [CDK8S](https://cdk8s.io/))
- Provide clients with services to deploy and maintain applications into the cloud

MUTUALIZE THOSE EFFORTS => LIBRARY CREATION

# Features

- Programmatically manage AWS Cloud
- Use usual programming languages
- Polyglot libraries thanks to [JSSI](https://github.com/aws/jsii)
- Use standard language libraries as part of CDK projects

---

# The GOOD

- Enable developers to manage their infrastructure with their preferred language
- Organize code with software architecture patterns
- Test code as any other code
- Review code as any other code
- Package code with application one
- One language to configure multiple aspects of the solution

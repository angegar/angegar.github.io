# Run AWS CLI from jenkins

## Introduction
As said in the [jenkins](https://github.dxc.com/lgil3/tutorials/tree/master/jenkins?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container) tutorial, our Jenkins setup is voluntarily kept simple and minimize. It implies that to work with AWS you will have to use a docker container.

We recommend to use the mesophere one (**mesosphere/aws-cli**) as it is based on linux alpine which the smallest linux distribution.

## Problem statement
